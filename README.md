# Code++ Website Database

This repository holds all of the scripts to populate, maintain, and query a MySQL database which interacts with an Angular application.
Scripts should be separated into a file for each different table. For example, put the create member and member query scripts in a file
named something like `members.sql`. Please check the [style guide] and submit code according to those styles.

If you would like to know how to access our database, please contact Tyler or Gonzo.
